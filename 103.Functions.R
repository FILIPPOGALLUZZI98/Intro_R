# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, 
# known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.

# To create a function, use the 'function()' keyword
f <- function(){
  'argument'}

# Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
# Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add
# as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma
